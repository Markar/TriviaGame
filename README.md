Frontend Setup is inside viewer-ui

<h2>
  <b>This project is currently a work in progress.</b>

  My initial approach was to plan out my screens with a pen and pad, then start
  implementing the UI with mock data in Redux, then implement a server and start 
  migrating logic out of redux into server-side calls and start fleshing out the 
  full workflow of the application. 

  For debugging purposes, I currently have a next button in the header for navigating
  through the screens easier. I need to refactor this using reach-router.
